# Common Rules (All Languages)

These rules apply to all projects, regardless of language. Language-specific rules live in the
corresponding `*_RULES.md` files.

---

## Keep CLAUDE.md in Sync

When working on a project, copy all relevant rules into the project's `CLAUDE.md` file:

- Always include the common rules from `COMMON_RULES.md`
- Also include the language-specific rules for the project's language
- If `CLAUDE.md` already exists, compare and update it to keep rules current and deduplicated

---

## Use Objects for Related Values

When multiple related values must be passed between classes or methods, bundle them into a
dedicated object (e.g., DTO/Settings/Config) instead of passing many parameters. This improves
readability, reduces call-site churn, and makes changes safer.

---

## Test-Driven Development for Features and Bug Fixes

Follow TDD when implementing features or fixing bugs:

1. Write tests first
2. Run the tests and confirm they fail
3. Implement the change or fix
4. Run the tests again and confirm they pass

---

## Prefer Type-Safe Values

Use strong, explicit types instead of loosely typed or stringly typed values (e.g., typed DTOs,
enums, generics, typed settings). This ensures mistakes are caught at compile time or by tests
early in development.

---

## String Constants

Centralize string constants in a dedicated module/class. Do not scatter raw strings across
the codebase. Use language-appropriate patterns for constants and reuse them consistently.

---

## README.md is Mandatory

Every project must have a `README.md` file in the root directory. It should include:

- Project name and description
- Installation/setup instructions
- Usage examples
- Dependencies and requirements

---

## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

Avoid code duplication. If the same logic appears in multiple places, extract it into a
reusable function, class, module, or utility.

- Duplicate code is harder to maintain and leads to bugs
- Extract shared logic into helpers or base abstractions
- Use constants for repeated values

---

## Confirm Dependency Versions

Before adding any new package or library, confirm the version with the user to ensure we use
up-to-date dependencies.

- Do not assume which version to use
- Ask the user to verify the latest stable version
- Avoid outdated packages that may have security vulnerabilities or missing features
